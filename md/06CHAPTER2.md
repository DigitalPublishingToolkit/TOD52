# CHAPTER 2. Intersections of Data Power: Unmasking the Nexus of Data Colonialism and Digital Racial Capitalism

### Nai Lee Kalema

## Summary

-   Modern global capitalism relied on processes of imperialism and
    racialization—a technology of power—to justify the differential
    relations of economic appropriation and exploitation —to extract
    racial surplus value. Thus, modern global capitalism has remained
    inextricably linked to racialization processes.

-   Today, digital transformations across global political-economic
    systems are giving rise to the emergence of digital racial
    capitalism. This is occurring through the convergence of digital
    transformation, racial capitalism, and data colonialism practices,
    resulting in digital- and data-mediated forms of racialisation,
    structural violence, and data necropolitics.

-   Digital racial capitalism creates racialized hierarchies of risk and
    vulnerability to data colonialism, by using data and digital tech to
    reconfigure or create new categories of racialisation (e.g.,
    migrant, terrorist, etc.), and digital technology and data-mediated
    harm. Racialized and ethnicized groups of people are structurally
    more vulnerable to hyper-surveillance and digital harms across
    several dimensions of intersectionality,

-   Digital racial capitalism conceptually explores how colonial power
    enables and is reproduced by data colonialism alongside the
    structurally violent implications of data colonialism. The data
    obtained from data colonialism is being used to create new forms of
    categorisation, stratification and racialisation that place people
    into different categories of ‘dispossessability’ and
    ‘disposability’.

What connects the complexities of colonialism –its multiple, linked
dimensions that Quijano called ‘the colonial matrix of power’– to wider
historical processes? In particular, what connects them to colonial
power relations generally is the continued role that racialism and
imperialism have played in the organization of economies and societies
during the past five centuries, particularly under capitalism? This is
what I explore in the rest of this chapter.

## Looking Back: Coloniality of Power 

In 1992, the Peruvian sociologist Aníbal Quijano introduced his concept
of the ‘Coloniality of Power’  — the structures of power, control, and
hegemony emerging from the era of historical colonialism continue to the
present day in the form of a global caste system.[^06CHAPTER2_1] The concept of the
coloniality of power emerged to look at how colonial legacies of power
were globally and locally interpreted and reconstituted throughout the
world and the complex dimensions of structural inequality stemming from
it. Coloniality of power *continues* to structure racialized, classed,
and gendered social hierarchical orders that privilege (or
provincialize) people, cultures, and knowledge systems. The association
of dominated groups of people with non-paid or non-waged labor was
premised upon their perceived inferiority based on coloniality's social
classifications and racialized hierarchies.[^06CHAPTER2_2] This concept brings into
greater relief how ‘social classification’ has structured social
inequality both within nations and globally as reflected in the current
day social and economic relations, particularly global capitalism and
the geopolitics of knowledge, that structure contemporary
societies.[^06CHAPTER2_3],[^06CHAPTER2_4]

There are very interesting links from this concept to earlier work on
the multiple complexities of how race interacts with other dimensions of
power. In her 1990 ground-breaking book, *Black Feminist Thought:
Knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment*, sociologist
and Black Feminist scholar Patricia Hill Collins introduced the concept
of the ‘Matrix of Domination’.[^06CHAPTER2_5] Conceptually, the Matrix of
Domination explores the interlocking systems of oppression along the
lines of race, gender, class, sexuality, and other social identities
that lead to the marginalization and othering of certain groups of
people.[^06CHAPTER2_6]

Extending from this, in 2000, Quijano conceptualized the ‘Colonial
Matrix of Power’' to articulate how the coloniality of power became
articulated through four key domains  –authority, economy, knowledge and
subjectivity, gender and sexuality– and propagated through racialism and
economic systems.[^06CHAPTER2_7],[^06CHAPTER2_8] As noted in chapter 1 by Alejandro Mayoral,
the colonial matrix of power produces new categories of racialization
across global and local granularities to justify and sustain
differential social relations of exploitation and appropriation of
resources and labor depending on an identity group's positionality in
racialized hierarchies. But from here, it is only a short step to see
that capitalism itself, far from merely being a matter of the
organization of the economy, is also always from the start a social
formation, that is, *racial* capitalism.

## Racial Capitalism 

Historian Eric Williams’ book, *Capitalism and Slavery*, illustrates how
modern global capitalism emerged from the transatlantic slave trade
between Europe, Africa, and the Americas. First, the premature
accumulation of vast sums of capital extended from the surplus value
elite actors were able to extract from the labor of enslaved African
people; the surplus value extracted from their labor would later play a
pivotal role in financing the industrialisation of Europe and the
Americas.[^06CHAPTER2_9] Colonial imperial expansion has remained entangled with
modern global capitalism through its reliance on racialisation as a
technology of power to extract racial subsidies by marking racialized
populations of people as inherently more disposable through racist
scholarship, policies, and state violence.[^06CHAPTER2_10]

Williams’ work would later be expanded upon through the Black Radical
Tradition's concept of 'Racial Capitalism'. Political Scientist Cedric
Robinson conceptualized Racial Capitalism to describe how ‘the
development, organization, and expansion of capitalist society pursued
essentially racial directions, so too did social ideology. As a material
force, then, it could be expected that racialism would inevitably
permeate the social structures emergent from capitalism’.[^06CHAPTER2_11] The
racial capitalism thesis investigated how racialist ideologies, like
white supremacism and antiblackness, were used to structure power along
political and economic systems through racialized
hierarchies.[^06CHAPTER2_12],[^06CHAPTER2_13],[^06CHAPTER2_14]

Importantly, racial capitalism does not ascribe intentionality,
sociologist Gargi Bhattacharyya elaborates that ‘racial capitalism is a
way of understanding the role of racism in enabling key moments of
capitalist development — it is not a way of understanding capitalism as
a racist conspiracy or racism as a capitalist conspiracy’.[^06CHAPTER2_15] Ruth
Wilson Gilmore, a political-economic geographer, articulates the
coevolutionary nature of racialism and capitalism in shaping the
contemporary global political-economic systems, emphasizing that
‘capitalism requires inequality and racism enshrines it’.[^06CHAPTER2_16] Gillmore
highlights that race is ‘the modality through which political-economic
globalization is lived’ and materiality felt by people.[^06CHAPTER2_17] As the
digital transformations of those modalities occur, the logic
undergirding them, unfortunately, remains the same —imbued with
‘colonialism’s economic imperatives— expansion, exploitation,
inequality’.[^06CHAPTER2_18] Racial Capitalism’s economies of dispossession are
still very present in global digital transformation processes. Thus,
many critical digital scholars are looking back while looking forward to
conceptually looking at the interconnectivities between racialism,
capitalism, and the
digital.[^06CHAPTER2_19],[^06CHAPTER2_20],[^06CHAPTER2_21],[^06CHAPTER2_22],[^06CHAPTER2_23],[^06CHAPTER2_24]

So, then, what is racial capitalism? Racial capitalism ‘speaks not of
racialization, but rather of racializations in the plural’.[^06CHAPTER2_25]
Essentially, racial logics are both globally and locally constituted.
The factors that undergird global racialism also create across local
geographies ‘racial categories, structuring race relations via laws,
labor and spatial territory demands, the transportation of bodies across
borders, and building early ideologies and justifications of racial
rationale and violence’.[^06CHAPTER2_26] Consequently, while racialization is
articulated differently in different places, it is still produced
relative to needs of ‘the global capitalist order’.[^06CHAPTER2_27] Thus, critical
digital studies scholars are both looking back at historical European
colonialism and postcolonial neocolonialism and forward at its modern
incarnation.

Critically, racialization is used as a technology of power to legitimize
the subjugation and oppression of some groups of people over others in
the modern global economy. Global racial capitalism is promulgated
through economic, political, and knowledge systems at the global and
local levels. While global white supremacy remains at the apex of the
global hierarchical order under global racial capitalism, it cannot be
reduced to bodies alone. Rather, whiteness remains ‘materially and
symbolically represented’ through a particular group's position at the
apex of a racialized hierarchy.[^06CHAPTER2_28] National racialized hierarchies are
embedded into global racial capitalism's own racial hierarchy. Not only
do people occupy different positionalities on multiple hierarchies at
once but also access to ‘symbolic whiteness’ is premised on factors that
extend beyond one's phenotypic expression.

This provides a deeper basis from which
to understand recent debates about the digital and data. The emergence
of digital capitalism relies on the accumulation of data. Zuboff
explains how surveillance capitalism enables actors to extract massive
amounts of data as a strategic asset for possible later use through her
concept of behavioral surplus.[^06CHAPTER2_29] While data dispossession is
fundamental to data capitalism, communities’ level of vulnerability to
data dispossession and its harms is tied to racial capitalism.



Racialized communities are more likely to be hyper-surveilled and thus
more vulnerable to data dispossession.[^06CHAPTER2_30],[^06CHAPTER2_31] Thus, the types of
beliefs used to justify the predatory expropriation and exploitation
seen around data—to get the behavioral surplus that facilitates the
emergence of digital capitalism—are tied to racialisation. Cedric
Robinson explains that as ‘surplus was necessary to the production and
reproduction of capitalism, it necessitated discipline and management,
through constant and differing modes of racialization’.[^06CHAPTER2_32] is not
merely apolitical and non-ideological but also premised on very old (and
some new) ideological foundations worth examining.

Racialism is central to capitalism. It helps legitimize the inequality
that capitalism requires by creating fiction about the differential
worthiness of human groups based on the myths of racialization.[^06CHAPTER2_33]
Coloniality is the ideological basis used to explain the differential
worthiness ascribed to human beings  — based on the bodies they occupy,
cultures they are part of, and geographies they find themselves in or
from —  to justify inequality.[^06CHAPTER2_34] Imperialism, racialism, and
coloniality converge to create a fiction about the differential
worthiness of human beings to sort people into categories of (1)
disposability and (2) dispossessability in across political and economic
systems.[^06CHAPTER2_35],[^06CHAPTER2_36] Digital racial capitalism's innovation upon racial
capitalism is in its use of digital technologies, digital transformation
processes, and datafied ways of knowing to devalue, exclude, and
stratify human beings in ways that are tied to and extend beyond prior
iterations of racialism.

Central to this process of digital racial capitalism —in today’s Big
Data era— is data colonialism. Data colonialism is commodifying human
relations, bodies, and behaviors *through data*.[^06CHAPTER2_37] The hierarchies of
risk in terms of which bodies, categorized through the uses of data, are
most vulnerable to that dispossession and its implications are tied to
existing forms of structural oppression and types of racialisation.
These generate the basic features of today’s data-driven digital racial
capitalism.

## Digital Racial Capitalism

The convergence of global racial capitalism, imperialism, and data
colonialism is leading to the emergence of new types of risks and harms
that are mediated through Big Data, AI, and digital technologies. These
data and digital-technology-mediated risks and harms are unevenly
distributed along intersectional racialized hierarchies that mark some
populations of people as inherently more dispossesable and disposable
and thus more vulnerable to data colonialism, hyper surveillance,
algorithmic harm, and structural violence, or in other words, digital
racial capitalism.[^06CHAPTER2_38] Digital racial capitalism also explores how data
and digital technologies, like AI, are being used to create new forms of
racialisation —ascribing racial meanings to a relationship, practice, or
group for the purpose of domination, exploitation, and social
exclusion—[^06CHAPTER2_39] through data and the algorithmic sorting of people.
Digital racial capitalism exacerbates existing and perpetuates new
patterns of racialization and categorization among populations based on
levels of disposability, and exposure to data-driven necropolitics.
Digital racial capitalism both proceeds and extends from data
colonialism. Finally, digital racial capitalism explains how digital
risks and harms get structured in society whereas the structural
violence of digital systems, algorithmic technologies, and data
relations are disproportionately present at the bottom of racialized
hierarchies. tied to global capitalism.[^06CHAPTER2_40]

Digital racial capitalism is being instrumentalized through the state as
well. At different points in time, governments have deployed differing
logics of distribution and calculations of racialization to decide who
should make up the deserving versus undeserving among their citizens and
non-citizens alike.

How states determine who lives and dies through their bureaucratic and
administrative systems is what political theorist Achille Mbembe
conceptually refers to as ‘Necropolitics’*.* Mbembe’s concept of
Necropolitics explores how assemblages of power instrumentalize human
life for some populations while managing the material destruction of
other populations.[^06CHAPTER2_41] In turn, this shift which is dependent on the
use of computers has led to societal transfixation with not only
predicting the future and sorting people into categories of
dispossessability but also the preoccupation of powerful private and
public actors alike with manufacturing the future through the means of
instrumentarian power be it through its velvet-gloved ‘nudges’ or other,
more direct, ways.[^06CHAPTER2_42]

Reminiscent of Couldry and Mejias' explication on data colonialism's
commodification of human life itself, Mbembe articulates how
computational capitalism's molecular deployment of race through the
identification of biological differences has taken a techno-genomic
turn, whereas data and the digital are being utilized to demarcate
further human variation beyond the phenotypical.[^06CHAPTER2_43] Underwriting the
global resurgence in racialism and ethnonationalism is a belief in the
division of humanity into groups based on one's assumed superiority over
another. These ideologies of xenophobia and supremacism are not new.
What is new is how they are being operationalised and reconfigured
through digital technologies targeted at surveilling the bodies of
people who are minoritized, racialized, and subalternized in the name of
‘security’.

Mbembe illustrates this point further, saying: ‘We particularly need to
explore the emerging nexus between biology, genes, technologies, and
their articulations with new forms of human destitution. At stake in the
contemporary reconfigurations and mutations of race and racism is the
splitting of humanity itself into separate species and subspecies as a
result of market libertarianism and genetic technology’.[^06CHAPTER2_44] In a
sense, Mbembe is warning about how data and the digital are being used
to create new racialised typologies of people based on their behavioral
data that can be used to limit, exclude, deny, dehumanize, and
ultimately kill —facilitating the emergence of data necropolitics.[^06CHAPTER2_45]

Bhattacharyya explains that global racial capitalism's ‘sorting of
global and local populations into hierarchies of disposability is
assisted by practices of racialisation’.[^06CHAPTER2_46] In the context of digital
racial capitalism, data colonialism is facilitating the sorting of
populations along hierarchies of disposability today as marked by their
level of actual or risk of subjugation to data necropolitics of the
state.

Data necropolitics refers to the forms of digital governance that expose
people to health inequalities, social violence and death (both literal
and social) and how data is instrumentalized by governments to normalize
health and social inequity.[^06CHAPTER2_47] According to the political scientist
Michael Chisnall, ‘the subsequent use of such data to feed technology
that seeks to control our behaviour, emotions and consumption, so
diminishing our capacity to appropriate our own lives, is morally
repugnant’.[^06CHAPTER2_48] The extensive and exploitative nature of data
extractionism and the ways in which people's personal data is being
instrumentalized is self-alienating, diminishing people's positive
freedoms and cultivating what Chisnall describes as the emergence of
digital slavery.

## Conclusion

In sum, racialism (along with other intersectional categories) is
utilized to facilitate the exploitative social relations necessary to
enable data colonialism's processes of dispossession. In turn, data
colonialism is facilitating digital racial capitalism, producing
contemporary states’ *data* necropolitics. To put it succinctly, data
colonialism and digital racial capitalism are co-constitutive of one
another and facilitative of global digital domination, in the process
diminishing people's agency (e.g. their ability to contest decisions) as
well as alienating people from their data.
