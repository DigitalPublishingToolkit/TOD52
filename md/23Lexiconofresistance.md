# Lexicon of resistance 

## Justice

There are numerous definitions within justice theory that situate it
within the fields of philosophy, law, ethics, among others. Miranda
Fricker proposed in her 2007 monograph, an approach that moves beyond
the established frames of distributive accounts of economic disparities
or political accounts of proceduralism at institutional level. Instead,
she criticizes the way justice creates an impression that it is the norm
and injustice the unfortunate aberration. She coined the term ‘epistemic
injustice’ in order to talk about the level of representation and
participation in knowledge production. Epistemic injustice occurs when
dominant structures in knowledge production result in; exclusion and
silencing, invisibility, inaudibility and having one's contributions
distorted, misheard and/or having diminished status in communicative
practices.[^23Lexiconofresistance_1],[^23Lexiconofresistance_2],[^23Lexiconofresistance_3] Thus, epistemic justice implies the right
of every person to their own knowledge and ways of generating,
legitimizing and valuing it.[^23Lexiconofresistance_4]

Moreover, the concept of social justice may be understood as the
continuing efforts to create and sustain a fair and equal society in
which all people and groups are valued and affirmed. It is defined by an
openness to change, seeking to end the systems that devalue the dignity
of individuals. It recognizes that the legacy of the past remains and
people continue to struggle for justice in their contemporary contexts.
Therefore, social justice is not considered to be a goal to be achieved,
but rather an ongoing process that promotes action in support of
restoration and implementation of human and civil rights.[^23Lexiconofresistance_5],[^23Lexiconofresistance_6]

## Communality

Communality is the thought and action of community life.[^23Lexiconofresistance_7] It
expresses universal principles and truths with regard to indigenous
societies, which should be understood from the outset not as something
opposed to, but as different from Western societies.[^23Lexiconofresistance_8] From a
philosophical approach, it is an experiential concept that allows the
integral, total, natural and common understanding of life based on the
interdependence of its elements, temporal and spatial, as well as the
capacity of the living beings that conform it.[^23Lexiconofresistance_9]

The elements that define communality can be understood as:

-   The Earth, as Mother and as territory.

-   Consensus in Assembly for decision making.

-   Free service as an exercise of authority.

-   Collective work as an act of recreation.

-   Rites and ceremonies as an expression of the communal gift.[^23Lexiconofresistance_10]

In sum, communality is based on respect for diversity and the principles
of respect, reciprocity and a work that allows the survival of the world
as a whole, as well as that of each of its instances and elements, which
achieves well-being and enjoyment.[^23Lexiconofresistance_11]

## Autonomy

Autonomy is a feature of the decision-making process or the formation of
normative judgments.[^23Lexiconofresistance_12] The modern-day concept addresses personal
autonomy insofar as the agent may elect to act, or not to act, according
to specified prescribed standards, norms or rules. It is generally
accepted that autonomy is that condition when an agent may determine the
conception, articulation and execution of concepts, ideas and actions
for themself.[^23Lexiconofresistance_13] According to Álvarez, autonomy is opposed to models
of domination and oppression; rejects dependency resulting from the
denial of moral recognition of people, thus rejecting discrimination and
marginalization; and it condemns authoritarianism insofar as it
represents the denial of the denial of the capacity for political
choice.[^23Lexiconofresistance_14] When it comes to societies, Cornelius Castoriadis affirmed
in 2006 that they are autonomous only when they are lucid with respect
to the artificial character of their institutions. From this
perspective, the autonomy of each subject is articulated with a
collective dimension and is composed together with others.[^23Lexiconofresistance_15]

## Sovereignty

Sovereignty is the exclusive right to exercise supreme political
authority (legislative, judicial, executive) over a geographical region,
over a group of people, or over themselves. Deleanu states that it ‘is
not a magic word, an occult and miraculous force; it expresses the right
of the state to decide for itself. However, sovereignty cannot be any
pretext for arbitrariness, voluntarism, arrogance or
self-consolation’.[^23Lexiconofresistance_16]

## Disobedience

Disobedience has to do with proposing new and provocative paths, new and
disturbing questions, and to dream of daring alternatives through which
the image of another possible reality is filtered.[^23Lexiconofresistance_17] In such a way,
to think disobedience is in the first instance an exercise of thinking
order, structure, norms and, strictly speaking, power relations.[^23Lexiconofresistance_18]
One of the most widespread forms of disobedience is civil disobedience,
a mechanism of participation and political protest used by minorities in
the process of shaping public opinion. It’s a form of political
dissidence that’s highly valuable in order to revitalize the
participatory fundamentals of representative democracy.[^23Lexiconofresistance_19]

## Care

According to Colliére, care is ‘everything that helps to live and makes
it possible to exist’. It is both a relationship and a process, a social
capacity and an activity, and it’s directed to everything that nurtures
and stimulates life. It is a kind of relationship constituted by a
genuine disposition towards the other, reciprocity and the commitment to
promote their well-being and flourishing. That is, prioritizing care
means recognising and embracing our interdependencies.[^23Lexiconofresistance_20]^,^[^23Lexiconofresistance_21] Care
policies encompass public measures concerning the social and economic
organization of work to ensure the day-to-day physical and emotional
well-being of people. They concern both the recipients and providers of
care, and include measures to ensure access to the services, time and
resources needed for giving and receiving care, as well as regulations
and oversight to safeguard its quality.[^23Lexiconofresistance_22]
