# 10 Ways to Resist Data Colonialism

1.  Identify the ways in which datafication is operating in your daily
    life.

2.  Embrace digital communality and data stewardship (common good).

3.  Prevent and diminish varying forms of structural oppression that
    gets embedded in data and digital architectures, which includes the
    duty to demand reparations from data harms.

4.  Organize your community and support communities most affected by
    data colonialism while enhancing your data protection to the extent
    that you can.

5.  Support strong legislation and policy frameworks to promote data
    justice and limit platform abuse and market concentration,
    especially in the “Global South.”

6.  Promote alternative forms of data governance. Communities can
    develop data models, but also countries.

7.  Promote a permacultural approach to data and technologies (promote
    policies that take responsibility for the environmental impact of
    the digital economy.).

8.  Develop other tools and models of knowing/doing data through
    alternative values for data justice.

9.  Fight for justice for the workers whose labor is exploited within
    the data economy.

10. Add your own actions!
