# STORY 9. Between cleaning apps and the border: Roxy's story for Domestic Code in the flesh

### Kruskaya Hidalgo Cordero[^19STORY9_1]

It has been 22 years since Roxy left Mexico City with a suitcase and
crossed the border into the United States.[^19STORY9_2] She escaped the
structural violence, the narco, the bad governments. She decided to
leave with her then boyfriend –who is now her husband– after he was
kidnapped in Mexico. They migrated out of fear that something like that
would happen again. They came to California and stayed in Los Angeles,
where they made their new home. Roxy is 41 years old, has a 21-year-old
daughter and 18-year-old twins. She has worked in cleaning and property
maintenance since she arrived in California, through word-of-mouth
recruitment, various agencies, web advertising sites and different
*apps*. Her two decades of work anecdotes show the changes in the U.S.
care labor market and, above all, the technification and capitalist
competition against paid work in the home.

One of the first experiences she recounts in the cleaning field was
between 2004 and 2007, when she worked for a beach house cleaning agency
in Venice Beach. One day she arrived with another colleague to clean a
house and while dusting the kitchen shelves, she found a gun. They were
both scared out of their wits. ‘I opened the spoon drawer and found a
gun. So, I grab it and go and lock the door. There was only one door to
get in and out. I told my partner, "we have to lock it because they are
going to come for it" and we got scared’, she says.

Roxy then called the agency supervisor and tried to explain the
situation: ‘I spoke little English and she spoke little Spanish, so I
told her that there was a *gun*[^19STORY9_3] in an *apartment*’. The supervisor
told her to leave the gun in the drawer and to leave the place
immediately. ‘That's when I said “no more, I don't want this job
anymore, I don't want to put my life at risk, and for so little money"’.
So she stopped working with the cleaning agency and soon after, she
joined Craigslist – a classified ads website. She worked with Craigslist
for more than eight years.

Moving into Roxy's experiences in the platform economy, she has worked
with several different cleaning *apps*, including Jan-Pro and Care. In
none of the *apps* Roxy has worked with can the paid domestic workers
rate the clients, nor can they leave feedback for them. However, clients
do rate them and do leave comments on their profiles, which are public.
For Roxy, this way of rating *apps* is unfair. In addition, clients
often rate them poorly for subjective reasons and prejudices, such as
their nationality, and not because of the work they do.

‘I would like to rate the clients. One would also put little stars on
them and say “watch out for this person because this happened to me with
her”’. Roxy insists on this because the *apps* do not allow paid
domestic workers to be in contact with each other. So they have no way
of alerting others if a client is harassing, discriminating, racist, and
so on. Therefore, Roxy demands that they, as workers, should also be
able to leave comments and rate them.

This reveals the unethical practices of these platforms, where control
and inequality are found in the very design of the application. But,
moreover, where the personal information of workers such as their age,
their photograph and their name are datafied, extracted and
commercialized. An economy based on the extraction of data where –it is
redundant– the data flows of workers, in particular of migrant and
irregularized women, end up in the hands of certain countries and
certain companies.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

Since the beginning of the 21st century, the crisis of social
reproduction has triggered a gigantic demand from the Global North for
care workers from the Global South, mainly women. According to the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, 88% of domestic workers, caregivers and
nannies are women. Of these, 49% are Latinas. In other words, 1 out of
every 2 domestic workers in the U.S. are Latinas. In cleaning apps this
trend continues, however, this does not mean that Spanish-speaking paid
domestic workers have the language barriers solved by their
overrepresentation in the sector.

In fact, one of the most common barriers faced by Roxy and many migrant
workers is language. Their command of English is sometimes beginner or
intermediate and this creates tensions with clients.

> They see us as ignorant because of the accent, because you don't speak
> English very well. Sometimes they \[the clients\] don't speak Spanish
> and they get frustrated because they think you don't understand them
> or something... I understand a little bit of English, but my sister
> didn't go to school here or anything, and she doesn't understand
> anything. With her it's more of a problem, so I tell her to take a
> picture if there's something wrong and I send a message to the client
> and tell her what's wrong and so on.

These barriers are often also discrimination, racism, xenophobia. They
are not only difficulties, they are pains. It is the encounter and
disagreement between various forms of oppression; it is the incarnation
of *border subjectivities in the* words of the Chicana Gloria
Anzaldúa.[^19STORY9_4]

On the other hand, some cleaning *apps* in the U.S. require workers to
be citizens. Others ask for residency and others for a social security
number. But the control is not very strict, the need to work is pressing
and there are many irregular workers working with the *apps*. As the
slogan says, ‘we are everywhere’ and *migrant women* are in the *apps*
as well.

The Jan-Pro platform functions as a digital job marketplace where
cleaning service providers and seekers meet. In other words, Roxy is
considered a cleaning service provider who has her own business. She has
a profile on the app where she promotes her business. To open it, she
had to make a one-time payment. ‘In Jan-Pro you start with \$900, it's
like a down payment. They say it's not a franchise, it's 900 dollars as
a down payment according to, but they keep that, they don't give it
back. It's a, oh, I don't know how they said, the word... a deposit’.

In addition to the non-refundable deposit, Roxy tells us that in Jan-Pro
one can invest money to get better houses or offices to clean. A sort of
auction to compete for a place to be cleaned on a monthly basis, on a
‘permanent’ basis.

That is, many of these platform companies offer places with large
cleaning areas, such as offices and houses of more than 300m^2^. Then,
if the workers ‘win’ that offer, they must hire more people. In other
words, the *apps* do not assign them cleaning shifts, but they must
compete to win a job. In most cases, they subcontract to people in the
process of regularization or irregularized in order to have competitive
prices and win the bids. In addition, the compañeras hire their
relatives, people from their community, and other migrant people to lend
them a hand. ‘The *app* says that if you need to hire people to help
you, they have to be legal in this country, so you get into trouble
because it is not true. I, for example, am just in the process of
arranging it’.

Roxy's dream is to have her own *app* business. An *app* that pays a
fair price, provides accident insurance for workers, cares about the
well-being of co-workers and thinks about the cleaning products used at
work. ‘I would like to have my own *app* and help maids to get *insured*
and get jobs. Make nice *flyers*, nice *business cards* and have letters
of recommendation. Everything so they don't struggle like I struggled,
so they don't suffer so much!’

Roxy mentions that the products that clients have for cleaning offices
and homes, most of the time, are very toxic. The use of these products
affects the health of the workers and also the environment. ‘I want to
use liquids that don't harm us or the customer. What I always tell them
when I go to an office and I see commercial liquids is "*oh, to be
honest*, to be honest, *I don't like this kind"*. Sometimes I ask for
*baking soda* and vinegar’.

Unlike the other apps in the region, Roxy faces a much more tech-driven
platform economy in the United States. Where the idea of ‘be your own
boss’ is stretched to the point of ‘have your own business within the
app’ or ‘be your own sole proprietorship’. Despite this, Roxy dreams of
having her own app, an app that helps paid domestic workers to get
decent jobs, accompany them in their regularization processes, have
labor contracts, social security, and also have cleaning implements that
do not harm the health of workers and nature.

Paid domestic workers within these apps dare to imagine other possible
ways of working with these platforms. They generate ingenious tactics to
resist the datafication of care work and algorithmic control: taking
pictures before cleaning to demonstrate their work, using their migrant
network to translate into English, relying on the community to hire
irregularized people. Roxy dreams, imagines, envisions other possible
technologies for paid housework. It is there, in ‘the app we dream
of’[^19STORY9_5] that she enunciates her resistance to datafication. It is a
latent desire to deactivate the hegemonic and dehumanizing algorithms
from the migrant collective body itself.

[^19STORY9_2]: Roxy's story told here is part of a long term project called
    Domestic Code in the flesh. A militant research proposal that
    questions the hegemonic reading inscribed in the skin of which are
    the bodies that perform domestic work and under what parameters of
    performance and efficiency this work is organized. A space to
    imagine how we would like these apps to be and at the same time a
    counter-territory where paid domestic workers and those who work on
    this project connect outside the algorithmic mechanism of the apps.

[^19STORY9_3]: Please note that my conversations with Roxy have been in Spanish.
    However, when she speaks, she uses certain words and phrases in
    English. In the words of Gloria Anzaldúa (1987), this reveals the
    language of the borderlands, a working-class English, a slang
    English, a Mexican Spanish, a Chicano Spanish, a Tex-Mex. In short,
    the complexity of migrant communities and the myriad of languages
    they speak. For this reason, I italicize all the words he says in
    English in his original account.

    Education of Southern California (IDEPSCA).
