# STORY 7. Resisting Data Colonialism and Digital Surveillance in a Midwestern Classroom: Exploring Community-driven Alternatives to Automated License Plate Readers 

### Chamee Yang, Gowri Balasubramaniam, Clara Belitz and Anita Say Chan

‘Everyday lived experience is the richest form of data’, James Kilgore,
the Urbana, Illinois, USA-based educator and activist said in critiquing
the persistent growth of electronic monitoring technologies and law
enforcement tools across small towns and large cities alike in 2022.[^17STORY7_1]
The observation underscores the alarming breadth and scale of data
capture that social justice advocates in diverse geographic contexts
have had to contend with as the processes of data colonialism accelerate
around the world, particularly through the expansion of security
technologies. This essay explores the growing drive to automate security
from the geographic and economic ‘periphery’ of high-tech and finance
capitals[^17STORY7_2] on the U.S. east and west coasts. This essay’s deliberate
focus on micro-urban contexts and ‘flyover country’ of Central Illinois
explores the range of efforts –and the use of class-based engagements
specifically– to resist the growth of data-driven surveillance systems
outside of large urban metropolises. We further problematize framings of
‘the North’ as a monolithic construct, and instead acknowledge the
long-standing dynamics of value extraction from diverse global
peripheries (even within ‘the North’ itself) to feed the growth of
centers[^17STORY7_3],[^17STORY7_4] that extends into contemporary datafication regimes.
While the data politics of ‘flyover country’ have been largely
overlooked in comparison to the nation’s coasts and larger Midwestern
cities like Chicago or Detroit, we argue that such oversights miss
opportunities to attend to the specific dynamics of data colonialism and
their resistances as they evolve in diverse geographic zones and local
‘peripheries’ within the North itself. As critical data scholars Nick
Couldry and Ulises Mejias posit,[^17STORY7_5] today’s emerging state of
data-driven capitalism has expanded by enabling Northern corporations to
profit from data gathered from diverse regions around the world, while
undermining the data sovereignty of political bodies and actors in the
periphery. This applies not only to national interests in the Global
South but also, as we point to here, to the circumvention of democratic
oversight in local regions even in ‘the North’ itself.

This essay thus underscores the localizing processes of data colonialism
through tracking the growth of data-driven security industries –and
their resistances– from Urbana, IL –a micro-urban context in the
Midwestern U.S. Attention to such contexts demonstrates how marginalized
populations, communities of color, and ‘peripheral’ geographies have
been increasingly targeted by data-driven security companies as
strategic assets for data exploitation and local market opportunities.
This parallels the growth of surveillance technologies in ‘smart city’
initiatives, where increasingly spatialized and automated forms of
management strategies seek to render the population more ‘knowable and
governable’ through data.[^17STORY7_6] We also provide a snapshot of our use of a
Midwestern university classroom and a Community Data graduate seminar
–one of two classes seeded at the University of Illinois in the Spring
2022–[^17STORY7_7] that were developed to document and critically refuse such
expansions. Our local resistance to data colonialism ‘at the periphery’
invests in community infrastructures and alternative pedagogies through
the use of classrooms as critical technologies that contrast with
data-driven security systems. The Community Data class drew attention to
varied civic organizations’ critique of police and municipal contracts
for Automated Licence Plate Readers (ALPRs) as an alleged deterrent to
violent crime across the nation, while highlighting groups’ work to
develop alternatives to commercial surveillance systems in local
communities.[^17STORY7_8]

While ALPR architectures have been roundly critiqued over the last
decade for subjecting minority populations to heightened forms of
criminalizing surveillance and for lack of proven efficacy in reducing
violent crime, new ALPR vendors like Flock Safety[^17STORY7_9] stress their use
of predictive and AI-based technologies and expanded data pools to
promise enhanced efficacy to local municipalities, despite the lack of
empirical evidence on ALPRs’ impacts on violent crime.[^17STORY7_10] Due to
heightened concerns raised by citizens over the lack of evidence-based
efficacy surrounding the technology, and reports presented –including by
the authors– on the efficacy of alternative community-based approaches,
the city of Urbana declined the use of ALPR in 2022.[^17STORY7_11] Flock
epitomizes the recent explosion of public-private surveillance models,
where government and public entities rely on the private sector to
produce surveillance information.[^17STORY7_12] While Flock pushes their product
to local police departments and municipalities, they also sell to large
national private groups, enabling the company's extractions to feed into
a large, centralized public-private surveillance network.[^17STORY7_13] These
surveillance models rely on, and recreate, colonial visions of
technological determinism and social control. As Dujuan ‘Zoe’ Kennedy, a
community organizer and violence interrupter with Force Detroit, put it
in an interview with students in the course, ‘We are targets. Not just
as people, but as a social construct’.[^17STORY7_14] For these reasons, the
American Civil Liberties Union joined local community groups in early
2023, calling for people to oppose Flock in their communities.[^17STORY7_15]

In a national context where rising rates of violent crime were coupled
with growing challenges for resource provision for public services
during the COVID-19 pandemic, the hyped ‘technological solutionism’ of
Flock could gain fast traction in local municipalities.[^17STORY7_16],[^17STORY7_17]
Problematically, the growth of such commercial surveillance
architectures not only normalizes the monitoring of citizens’ everyday
activities but further monopolizes data about minority communities in
ways that undermine, silence, and deprive community-led and driven
solution-making as alternative responses to local problems.

Following heated public debates in the Fall of 2021 after citizens were
notified of the Urbana Police Department’s consideration of an ALPR
contract with Flock, faculty, post-docs, and students at the University
of Illinois’ Community Data Clinic[^17STORY7_18] came together with Urbana City
Council members concerned over the persistent focus on surveillance tech
as the ‘only possible solution’ to crime. Together, we planned to
dedicate the Spring 2022 graduate seminar of the Community Data Clinic
to the topic of ALPRs. Using the classroom as a participatory
infrastructure and transformational technology, we recentered debates
around ALPRs to draw focus to the forms of justice-driven alternatives
led by community-based initiatives. It should also be noted that our
class was part of a broader set of cross-campus consensus and research
initiatives around community violence, such as Tariq Khan’s Spring 2022
class on Public History: Policing in the United States.[^17STORY7_19],[^17STORY7_20]
Throughout the semester, we zoomed out to focus on violence reduction as
a holistic problem and dove instead into enmeshed resistances in local
communities across various U.S. contexts. By doing so, we drew from the
work of other community-partnered researchers who describe their work as
‘centered on understanding and prioritizing how information and
information technologies can empower communities, support their
development, resilience, health, and well-being, promote
self-determination, social inclusion, and social justice, and bridge
divides’.[^17STORY7_21] One of the crucial premises underlying our efforts has
been recognizing community partners as experiential experts whose years
of lived experience and knowledge must be centered as pathways toward
transformative justice. By centering experiential expertise that is
based on lived experiences of community experts rather than just data
and statistics, we hoped to challenge the simplified and racialized
narratives about gun violence and promote more inclusive and holistic
approaches to addressing the issue.

Our class-based research thus explored cases of community work dedicated
to resisting data colonialism and the expansion of securitization
architectures in a range of U.S. contexts. Using qualitative research
methods, we opened up our classroom space to engage community
organizations nationwide that have played active roles in advocating for
non-surveillance approaches to gun violence. During the course of the
semester, we dedicated course time to collecting narratives, conducting
interviews, inviting community and Urbana City Council feedback, and
building relationships with key actors in a range of justice-based
initiatives recognized for deterring gun violence through
community-based programs - from Pittsburgh, PA’s Mad Dads,[^17STORY7_22] to
Oakland, CA’s Youth ALIVE!,[^17STORY7_23] and from West Palm Beach, FL’s Inner
City Innovators,[^17STORY7_24] to Detroit, MI’s Force Detroit.[^17STORY7_25] Our efforts
highlighted the strength of social infrastructures designed by community
leaders, and amplified their efficacy in a May 2022 Urbana City Council
Meeting where ALPRs were debated.

Among the findings we stressed were that community leaders’ long record
of work to build public understanding around gun violence as a leading
cause of death in communities of color preceded COVID-19’s deadly
impacts.[^17STORY7_26],[^17STORY7_27] As these community leaders emphasized,
gun-violence deaths in communities of color in Urbana and nationwide are
primarily driven by factors such as income inequality, poverty,
under-resourced public services, and easy access to firearms. This was
so much the case that in 1979 the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention declared gun violence a public health crisis. Like COVID-19,
gun violence is contagious and affects distinct populations
differently.[^17STORY7_28],[^17STORY7_29] Our findings further credited the dedication
of justice-based advocates who had long worked to build public
literacies around public health approaches to gun violence reduction
that stressed holistic and integrated solutions to address the root
causes of violence and reduce the precarity of people’s access to food,
shelter, and safety, particularly since these challenges are often
result of systemic inequality and the city’s historical neglect in poor
and Black neighborhoods.[^17STORY7_30] Such work highlighted how solutions can
thus take many forms, from housing assistance to after-school programs
to the distribution of free gun safes. Finally, we stressed how national
justice-based organizations’ investments around public health models
echoed the data politics of local organizers from citizen groups like
Urbana’s First Followers,[^17STORY7_31] and CU Fresh Start.[^17STORY7_32] Such groups have
maintained that a technology-centered punitive approach is an obstacle
to building trust and community-centered forms of safety.

In January 2022, the Urbana City Council voted down the proposal for
ALPRs in the city. Given the continued marketing of ALPRs to Central
Illinois cities like Urbana, the adoption of ALPRs by Urbana’s adjacent
twin city Champaign, and the success of Flock in selling its devices in
surrounding areas (from Peoria to Quincy and Gurnee, IL - and from
Comanche, IA to Wichita, KS in the Midwest alone),[^17STORY7_33],[^17STORY7_34] local
organizers expect new proposals to come. Our work thus continues a
second phase of this project to amplify the work of advocates for public
health and care-based approaches to addressing gun violence[^17STORY7_35],[^17STORY7_36]
and to resist the pressure to expand surveillance-based solutions. In
Urbana, the resistance continues as ALPRs are adopted in surrounding
towns and existing installations nearby are lauded as ‘successes’. We
note the efforts too of other Illinois-based data activists like the
Invisible Institute of Chicago,[^17STORY7_37] who have likewise begun to
recognize the importance of addressing data colonialism outside of large
cities Chicago, and who recently launched new civic tools to monitor
police abuses (to complement Chicago-based tools they previously
developed). Our local resistance to data colonialism ‘at the periphery’
offers a distinct if complementary approach to such tool-based
developments around counter data by investing in community
infrastructures, alternative pedagogies, and just and equitable
approaches to fostering safety communities outside of large cities –
where surveillance technologies like ALPRs present growing obstacles
rather than solutions.
