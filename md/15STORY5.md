# STORY 5. When Workers Exploit the Platforms

### Julian Posada

Eduardo[^15STORY5_1],[^15STORY5_2],[^15STORY5_3],[^15STORY5_4],[^15STORY5_5] is a former employee of
Venezuela’s Ministry of the Environment who lives with his wife and
elderly parents in the city of Coro near the country’s Caribbean coast.
The worsening economic situation and Eduardo’s position as the family’s
sole breadwinner prompted him to change jobs. Initially, he worked as a
schoolteacher, at first full-time and later more sporadically, after a
friend showed him how to make money online using a data labeling
platform. 

The platform has had many names: CrowdFlower, FigureEight, and, finally,
Appen, after an Australian company acquired it. Eduardo is a user of
this platform (in reality, an independent contractor) and classifies the
world from his home computer. Recent tasks have involved categorizing
companies according to their core business and clothing according to the
brand and type. He receives the instructions in English but reads them
in Spanish using Google Translate.

Even the latest iteration of the large language model, GPT-4, which uses
a technique called ‘Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback’ requires
human input –and labor– to operate. Platforms like the one Eduardo works
for have enabled a system where workers’ labor, knowledge, and cognition
is extracted from territories that have the tools for online work and
difficult economic situations as in the case of many in Venezuela and
other places in the Philippines, India, Kenya, and other countries
worldwide. Platform workers are required to generate, annotate, and
verify data, tasks that are essential for artificial intelligence
systems like GPT-4 to function.

When Eduardo started working for the platform, it was difficult to find
tasks because they could appear at any time of the day, sometimes in the
middle of the night and on any day of the week. However, the job
provides more income than his regular teaching job, up to ten U.S.
dollars per task, vastly exceeding the local minimum wage. As a
result, Eduardo decided to exploit the platform as much as possible. 

Of course, he realized that he could not make more money alone, so he
created a group with other workers in Venezuela, using Telegram to
communicate. At first, the group only included people Eduardo knew from
his neighborhood, but the group rapidly grew, accepting numerous people
from across the country. Eduardo pooled the membership fees to hire a
coder in Spain to develop a bot that alerts members when a task becomes
available, allowing them to work on it before it disappears. This tool
allows Eduardo and other members to focus on tasks and increase their
earnings. Their pooled fees also serve as a form of insurance, enabling
the group to help when something happens to a member, such as becoming
the victim of an online scam or facing some other emergency.

Workers also share insights about tasks and how to understand
English-language instructions, as well as tips for maximizing earnings
on the platform. These strategies can include using different accounts
simultaneously, despite the platform’s prohibition, which expects
obedient and autonomous workers. However, users with numerous accounts
and extensive networks of cooperation, motivated by resistance to
precarity, are the ones labeling their data. This may not be the
high-quality data the platforms’ clients desire, but it doesn't even
matter for people like Eduardo. For him, defending his family,
neighborhood, and colleagues—his community—is a priority. He is
unconcerned about some data that is used to train machines for some
unknown companies. 

Consequently, the platform profits but also falls victim to its design,
losing clients because cheap, controlled, and distributed labor does not
yield a superior product. This realization is not universal, enabling
Eduardo and his colleagues to resist and engage in myriad ways in the
ongoing fight against those who view labor is a mere
commodity.

[^15STORY5_1]: Eduardo is an anonymous worker who shared his experience with me
    during my journey as a researcher and educator. I want to use this
    venue to tell his story and share the projects of colleagues who are
    fighting against data extractivism and platform exploitation.
    Colleagues from the Fairwork project are ranking platforms based on
    five essential fair work principles—no single platform worldwide has
    had a minimum score. The Platform Cooperativism Consortium maintains
    a list of alternative platforms functioning as cooperatives, where
    workers have a voice in management and share ownership. Artist Mimi
    Onuoha and activist Mother Cyborg developed a pamphlet that explains
    artificial intelligence, its ethics, and societal implications. I
    included their project and other readings in a publication for the
    Mayworks Festival of Working People and the Arts. I want to thank
    the many workers like Eduardo who took the time to share their
    stories and believe that a better future of work is possible.
