# Resisting data colonialism: What lies ahead

### Paola Ricaurte Quijano

Given what we have learned about how data colonialism works, there is no
reason we have to accept the *status quo*. We need, collectively and
individually, to be disobedient and work towards a different, more just
world.

The peoples of the majority of the world have always developed
strategies and created spaces of resistance in spite of the will of
extermination and dispossession of the systems of violence. These
strategies of resistance can be considered as epistemic
disobedience:[^21Resistingdatacolonialism_1] a resistance that struggles to break away from the
coloniality of power, which is exercised through the coloniality of
knowledge, being and feeling.[^21Resistingdatacolonialism_2] The value of resistance lies in the
possibility of producing fissures in the systems of violence that make
existence possible. The native peoples of the world and many other
groups around the globe in search of autonomy, dignity and their right
to the future, have traced a trajectory of practices that have not
succumbed to the annihilating logic of the
capitalist/colonial/patriarchal model of the world.

This discussion raises important questions for thinking about what
potential alternatives or modes of resistance we can develop. That is,
if these values and ways of operation of data colonialism do not do us
much good, how can we go against them? In what way do subjects *resist*
the coloniality of power that materializes through datafication,
algorithmic mediation and automation? What does resistance mean in
conditions of extreme inequality, in contexts where the worst
expressions of capitalism, colonialism and patriarchy are
manifested?What are the consequences of the colonial mode in which data
operates in our life today?

Indeed, we have to ask: *Why* resist? What is the *meaning* of
resistance? The social order constructed through datafication is rooted
in historical and emergent forms of violence. Data extraction as a form
of dispossession generates economic, racial, gender, epistemic,
environmental, and other forms of injustice. There’s little care for the
social consequences of data systems, or the social worlds that they
directly impact. Our freedom, autonomy, other ways of knowing, and our
democracies are eroded. Realizing this is a departing-point for action.

## What is the meaning of resistance?

Resistance is a way of remaking the world. In this way, resisting is
re-existing. Albán refers to resistance as practices through which
communities recreate their material and symbolic worlds, and from there
confront inequalities, marginalization, discrimination and
racialization. Re-existence, then, is understood as ‘the redefinition
and resignification of life in conditions of dignity’.[^21Resistingdatacolonialism_3] To resist is
to re-exist, to explore alternatives for a dignified life and to delink
ourselves from that which subtracts humanity from us. Datafication, if
instituted as a dominant rationality governed by the market, becomes a
process that reduces us, quantifies our lives, redefines social orders
of classification and creates new knowledge orders. It also reinforces
social asymmetries. Datafication takes away our autonomy and our
capacity to make decisions, prefigurating our future. For this reason,
resisting in the context of datafied societies implies recovering
autonomy, sovereignty, communality, conviviality, but above all,
recovering our right to the future, and our forms of collective agency
despite actors who seek to appropriate our ways of sustaining life.

## How to resist?

Decoloniality as a political praxis, is a roadmap to imagine various
actions against data colonialism. Coloniality is multidimensional and we
need to understand it in order to imagine ways to resist data
colonialism. The repertoires of resistance might take the form of
material and immaterial alternatives that take into account the
plurality of forms of being, knowing, feeling, doing, and living in the
world. An act of resistance entails imagining tactics for disengagement
on various spheres of life in which oppressive datafication systems are
embedded: our social interactions, epistemic frameworks, bodies, and
territories. Thus, we can undertake legal, pedagogical, organizational,
communicative, technical, infrastructural, and creative actions of
resistance that allow the construction of a common sense of struggle. 

We can speak of forms of resistance to socio-technical violence on
multiple levels: on the one hand, resistance to the processes of
datafication, algorithmization and automation. On the other, resistance
on the continuum from the macro to the micro-political levels. Finally,
agency and resistance take place at various domains from the material to
the immaterial: infrastructures, practices, imaginaries or even the
unconscious.[^21Resistingdatacolonialism_4] Decolonial praxis takes different forms.

## What can I do? How can I get involved? How could things be different? 

Some people think that resisting datafication means passing legislation
or making technical adjustments. What we propose here is that resistance
does not mean that we can resist data coloniality only by changing the
technology behind it. We must also change the relationships that govern
the social and economic systems that support it.  This book offers some
practical take-away resources for starting to do just this!
